## Case study: Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery

---

#### *A story of successful adaptation to ocean acidification in the Pacific Northwest*

- ##### Scene 1: Exposition - Whiskey Creek and Importance to Network

    - Background about the hatchery

    - Importance to shellfish stakeholder network (***Sensitivity to OA***)

        > Whiskey Creek is a central node to a vast network of shellfish stakeholders in the Pacific Northwest, supplying seed to nearly 70% of independent shellfish growers in the region

- ##### Scene 2: Rising Action - OA and the Oyster Seed Crisis

    - The PNW is the global frontline (***Exposure to OA***)

    - Oyster seed crisis, its impact on Whiskey Creek, and therefore its impact on the entire network

- ##### Scene 4: Falling Action - Adaptive Capacity

    - Legislative action on OA led to dedicated funds for OA research
    - Assets unlocked new collaborations between scientists and stakeholders
    - Bivalve sensitivities - George Waldbusser
    - Burkalator monitoring - Burke Hales
    - Resources, Knowledge, and Technology (***Adaptive Capacity***)
